# Project Time Tracker

## Objective

Track and calculate total time spent per project per person

## Iteration 1

- Allow to create projects which have:
    - Name
    - Type: interior design, architecture.
    - Start date
    - End date
- Allow to add contributors to the project
- Each contributor can “check-in” and “check-out” from the project to track the time spent
- Each contributor can edit their “checks”
- Contributors can view the project stats at any time. The stats are:
    - Sum of time spent between all contributors
    - Total per contributor

## Iteration 2

- Allow “checks” to have “adjustments” so that users can subtract hours and provide a reason to track time wasted.
